## Powering Next-Level Perimeter Security and Access Control with Versitron PoE Switches

Securing a facility begins at the perimeter — where every gate, sensor, and access point must function flawlessly to protect people, assets, and data. Versitron’s industrial PoE switches are engineered specifically for these mission-critical environments, delivering not just power, but robust, low-latency connectivity to all your security devices — even under the harshest outdoor conditions.

### Why Choose Versitron PoE Switches for Security and Access Control?

Modern security systems depend on a tightly integrated network of cameras, sensors, access readers, and control panels. PoE switches eliminate the need for separate power lines, simplifying installation and reducing maintenance costs — but only if they’re built for the environment. Versitron’s PoE switches are designed to meet these exact demands:

- **Rugged Construction:** IP-rated enclosures and industrial-grade components protect against dust, moisture, vibration, and extreme temperatures, ensuring 24/7 uptime no matter the weather or environment.
- **Long Reach Power Delivery:** Support for PoE+ (up to 30W per port) means you can power advanced devices such as high-definition IP cameras, gate motors, and RFID readers without additional infrastructure.
- **Reliable and Secure Data Transmission:** Managed switch options offer VLAN segmentation, QoS prioritization, and port security, keeping your security traffic isolated and uninterrupted.
- **Flexible Deployment:** Whether mounted inside weatherproof outdoor enclosures or integrated into existing rack infrastructure, our switches offer multiple form factors and mounting options tailored to your site requirements.
